# Implementation of an AI algorithm to solve an 8 puzzle

First attempt at learning and implementing the A* search algorithm. This is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm. I know the code doesn't look neat so please don't flame me. It's also been a while since I coded this so I probably barely remember much so please don't flame me on that too.

## You can use any of the three heuritics

* Uniform-Cost Search (Not A*): This one is essentially brute force bfs.
* Manhattan Distance: How far away the misplaced tiles are from their proper spot.
* Misplaced Tiles: The number of misplaced tiles.
